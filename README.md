# Uncommon Dart Bug: Robust Asynchronous Operations and JSON Decoding

This repository showcases a common yet easily overlooked bug in Dart involving asynchronous operations and JSON decoding. The bug arises from the assumption that an API response will always be a JSON array, and the lack of robust error handling.

## Bug Description

The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to fetch data from an API. It makes the following mistakes:

1. **Assumes JSON array:** It directly casts the decoded JSON response to `List<dynamic>` without checking its type.
2. **Insufficient error handling:** The `catch` block only prints an error message. 

This can lead to runtime exceptions if the API response isn't a JSON array, or if network requests fail, providing a poor user experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a corrected version. The improvements include:

1. **Type checking:** The code now checks if the decoded response is a list before processing it.
2. **More informative error handling:** It provides detailed error messages and uses a more sophisticated approach to error handling, including specific exception types.
3. **Improved API call:** Includes better handling of potential errors during the API call itself.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` to observe the original bug.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see the improved solution. 

This example highlights the importance of rigorous error handling and proper type checking in asynchronous Dart code.
